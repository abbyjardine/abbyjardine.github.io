            <h1>A guru who loves design</h1>
            <p>Before being a guru I did a FAS course for web design working with HTML, CSS and Photoshop.<br><br>
                After that I went to design school for fine jewellery with the Crafts Council of Ireland and recieved a 
                diploma in Arts. Design is my jam. During my course, I learned a lot about how the best design is pared back to 
                leave the most essential information and express it effectively. The course also taught me how technique, 
                measuring and fine tuning your skill can be a vehicle for creativity.<br><br>
                I was interested in Shopify and the guru role because of my love for business and design and how 
                much I love to see other craftspeople and merchants communicate their ideas. I would love to help 
                more with this aspect of merchant's stores and move even further into my passion which is the design 
                side of ecommerce! Getting better at coding and utilizing the tools to express this would be a dream 
                for me!!</p>
